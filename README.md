# **Diabetes Health Insights: EDA of Pima Indians Dataset**
## Project Overview
- This project explores the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful health insights. The analysis focuses on understanding how key health markers relate to diabetes outcome and how factors such as age, BMI, pregnancies, and genetic risk influence diabetes likelihood.
## Objectives
- Analyse distributions of important health indicators.
- Compare health markers between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
- Examine relationships between BMI, glucose, age, pregnancies, and insulin.
- Explore correlation structure among all health variables.
- Evaluate how genetic risk influences diabetes outcomes.
